git doesnt have a hook for pre-svn-dcommit. This is to give you the ability to add your own hook for pre svn dcommit. 

	exit 0 from pre-svn-dcommit is success 
	any non zero exit from pre-svn-dcommit is failure.



install

 sh install.sh
 cp the pre-svn-dcommit to your .git/hooks/


uninstall
 
  sh uninstall.sh
